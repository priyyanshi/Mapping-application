# Photostorming: Mapping Application

This is a mapping application made for my Software Design and Communication (ECE297) course in a team of 3 using C++ and GTK3. We implemented A* pathfinding algorithm to provide best travel route between points and optimized a courier delivery algorithm for a courier company driver with multiple deliveries. The project was done over the course of 4 months.
